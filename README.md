# Cash Clicker!
This game is a port from a [Scratch game]([url](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/515730164/)) I made a while back. I really enjoyed it and thought it would be perfect to play on the sprig  while you wait for something.
I also had a lot of fun learning how to take something from block coding and convert it into JavaScript, a language I had never used before. (I've only used Python and Java before this).

## Goal
Get as much money as you can!

## Controls:
- W to click the coin (this gives money!)
- I to open/close the shop (ya gotta spend money to make money!)
- J to purchase "AC" or autoclicker, this gives you x amount of money every second. (x is written to the left of the button, price is written below)
- L to purchase "CPC" or clicks per click, this gives you more money per click. (your cpc is written to the left of the button, price is written below)
- A to toggle audio (sometimes the chime gets annoying after every click)
